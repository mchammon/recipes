    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600g white fish fillets (e.g. snapper or cod)</li>
        <li>1.5 cups plain flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cups cold water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 pieces large potatoes</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the chips: Peel and cut 4 pieces large potatoes into thick strips (about 1.5 cm wide). Pat dry thoroughly with a paper towel — this helps them crisp up.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil: Pour 4 cups vegetable oil (for frying) into a large, deep saucepan and heat over medium-high heat to around 180°C. If you don't have a thermometer, drop in a small piece of potato — it should sizzle immediately.</li>
        <li>Fry the chips: Cook the chips in batches for 5–7 minutes until golden and cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with a pinch of 1 teaspoons salt.</li>
        <li>Make the batter: In a bowl, whisk together 1.5 cups plain flour, 1 teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoons salt. Gradually add 1 cups cold water and whisk until you have a smooth, thick batter.</li>
        <li>Prepare the fish: Pat 600g white fish fillets (e.g. snapper or cod) dry and cut into serving-sized pieces. Lightly dust each piece with a little plain flour from 1.5 cups plain flour, then dip into the batter to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Fry the fish: Carefully lower the battered fish into the hot oil and fry for 4–5 minutes, turning once, until the batter is deep golden and crispy. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the fish and chips together immediately, seasoned with extra 1 teaspoons salt and a squeeze of lemon if desired.</li>
    </ol>
