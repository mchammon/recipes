    <p>AI Generated.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp green curry paste</li>
        <li>4 pieces egg whites (at room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 cups caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons cornflour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons vanilla essence</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh fruit (e.g. kiwifruit, strawberries, blueberries)</li>
        <li>1.3 cups whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven: Preheat your oven to 150°C. Line a baking tray with baking paper and draw a 20 cm circle on it as
        a guide.</li>
        
        <li>Beat egg whites: Using an electric mixer, beat 4 pieces egg whites (at room temperature) on high speed until
        stiff peaks form — the mixture should look glossy and hold its shape.</li>
        
        <li>Add sugar: Gradually add 1 cups caster sugar one tablespoon at a time, beating well between each addition, until
        the mixture is thick and glossy. This should take around 8 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Fold in remaining ingredients: Gently fold in 1 teaspoons cornflour, 1 teaspoons white vinegar, and 1 teaspoons
        vanilla essence using a spatula until just combined.</li>
        
        <li>Shape the pavlova: Spoon the mixture onto the circle on your baking paper. Shape it into a round with slightly
        raised edges to form a well in the centre for the toppings.</li>
        
        <li>Bake: Place in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 120°C. Bake for 75 minutes, then turn the oven off and leave the pavlova inside to cool completely — do not open the oven door.</li>
        
        <li>Whip the cream: Once the pavlova is fully cooled, whip 1.3 cups whipping cream with an electric mixer until soft
        peaks form.</li>
        
        <li>Top and serve: Spoon the whipped cream over the pavlova and top with 2 cups fresh fruit (e.g. kiwifruit,
        strawberries, blueberries). Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
